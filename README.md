Ok so this weekend there is a bundle on Humble bundle that has TCG cards, icons and
many other images one could use in building its own trading card game.
This is my quick idea how to draw cards on the beginning of the game.

<br>



 This code must have solutions for
* cards must be shuffled  before the beginning of the draw
* there must be several globally banned cards that cannot be picked
* each card that is drawn drawn must have a description
* after a card is drawn the same card must not be drawn again (ex is removed from the deck)
* limit a number of cards drawn (ex 6)
* number of drawn cards can me chosen by the user (6 or 7 cards)
